# Information Retrieval Final Assignment

Dear Martijn, 

We are students of Delft University of Technology writing to you in connection with a project we are looking to do for a course in Neural Networks. As the professor Judith Redi mentioned in her email earlier, we are interested in researching the application of Neural Networks in the problem domain of credit risk assessment. 

As we understand, credit risk assessment is a large problem domain with various categories of risk. Furthermore, we find that although credit risk is a well studied domain in the field of Neural Network, there are several differences in handling credit risk management for consumer and commercial finance. Hence, we would like to ask you if there is a specific domain for which you could provide us with data and domain knowledge so we can analyze the application of Neural Networks for the same.
